The "Parallel Runs.R" file corresponds to the code that produced the main model runs. The "Sensitivity Analysis.R" file corresponds to the sensitivity analysis.
Unfortunately, the MAXENT files that dictate cetacean distribution are not shareable and thus the model is not capable of running, despite all other input parameters
being available either in the code or in the manuscript (Tables 1 and S1).
